This pack will allow you to play starfox 64 with increased visual appeal.  It's a wip currently, as some graphics need to be done and some need to be upgraded.  But it's completed enough for it to be enjoyed nicely in its current state.

You need some things to get this thing working:

1:  project 64:

http://www.pj64-emu.com/

1.6 will suffice.

2:  the RICE video plugin:

Along with This.dll:

Install it by placign the RICE files in the plugin foler, and the BMGlib.dll file in the main p64 directory.  Then, start project 64, go options>Settings>Video(graphics)plugin and set it to the rice video plugin.  you now have acess to high resolution graphics for any games that have been modified:  to do this, go options>configure graphics plugin, and uncheck the "hide advanced settings" box in general options, then check the "load highres textures if avaliable" box in the textures filter tab.

3:  Star Fox 64 (U) [f1].v64

And that should do it.
